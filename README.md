# Smart-Merchandising-and-Sales-Prediction-System
This is my bachelors final year project. It has been developed using React Native, React and Google Firebase. <br/>

An application which will provide the people to rent or buy items belonging to four categories namely hardware machinery, consumer electronics, houses and vehicles, and the marketeers to manage their inventory in the form of outlets.<br/>
A feed forward neural network with sigmoid function as the activation function has been used for sales prediction.<br/>

This repository contains four applications. These are the following:<br/>
1. The main application in the master branch.<br/>
2. The marketeer application in the marketeer branch.<br/>
3. The admin application in the admin branch.<br/>
4. An application which shows the data, the sales prediction performed on it using feed forward neural network and autoregression in graph plots and the accuracies of these algorithms.
